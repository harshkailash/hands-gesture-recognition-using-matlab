For successful implementation of this project you should follow following steps
1) save guidemo.fig, grayalgo.m, speech.m into the same folder
2) save all the dataset images in the same folder
3) run guidemo and place your hand in front of webcam to make some signs and the output will be in front of you.


if you will not add speech.m then also program will run but an error will be displayed and speech won't be taken into consideration and code will not generate any speech output

if you don't add grayalgo.m in your project then code wont run because then illumination which helps in detecting skin wont be done.

you will have to download the images according to your sign language

you can find grayalgo.m and texttospeech.m anywhere.
